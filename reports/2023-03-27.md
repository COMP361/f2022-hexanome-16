### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

* Issues usually have more granularity than initially thought
* As the project grows in complexity it becomes harder to find the true source of bugs even with proper separation of concerns and best practices
* But those best practices are still very valuable :)

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

* Pending game actions with embedded data (e.g. noble conflict) fail to be parsed when creating a session from a savegame
* The client has an active timer thread for token refreshes even after window has closed
* Reserving cards needs more testing
