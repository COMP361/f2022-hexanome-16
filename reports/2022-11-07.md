### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

* The domain model took a lot more time than expected.
* For the first few calls we had a bit of a "too many cooks in the kitchen" situation.
* We weren't expecting our models to be so different from the catan models compared to the last milestones.

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

* Design documents take a very long time to create.
* Teamwork is good but we need to make sure we don't step on eachother's toes.
* Client/Server communication is complex and takes a lot of planning.
